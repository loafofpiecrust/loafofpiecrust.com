# Sneadophile

<SongPlayer title="Yr City’s a Sucker" artist="LCD Soundsystem" />

Sitting on that same park bench, Sneadophile squints his eyes in the sunlight. It was quite a delightful day. He hears the frequent squeals of the people, and the silence of the parklifes. Today there were three wheels: gouda, gouda, and gouda; he liked to think it was akin to Buddha if even in nothing but their name. The only religion anyone should need is cheese, as it surpasses all kings in benevolence, all gods in omnipotence, and all things in taste. The enhancement of French and Italian bread has always been like Jesus to God, or Kitsune to Inari, before those were even imagined.

Past the incredible power of cheese and lesser power of the baguette, Sneadophile always kept about him his white, pristine lab coat and inconspicuously conspicuous binoculars. His hair was similar to a combination of a mad scientist, and a neat psychopath, if the mix is possibly imaginable. In fact, he had made his binoculars himself, thus their conspicuous inconspicuousness and ability to see as far as they desired to see. Besides "inventing", his other, most personal, hobby was that of watching the children.

He wasn't always sure why he was so fascinated, but he could receive little input from others. Any friends who had discovered this habit had distanced themselves and began calling him a pedophile; even with the shorthand *name* Sneadophile from the jolly ones, based on his last name, Snead. Despite what most would think, he simply observes; he finds their behaviour to be *interesting*. Their morals were often better than the majority of adults, and even many in religious families cared little for religion. They found enough power and faith in life and its many gifts.

There was little to impart from this upon the rest of humanity, especially from a mad scientist/supposed pedophile, though it's not like I ever touch them, or even go near them. The “creepy” way that I eat bread and cheese is simply a coincidence created by my odd personality. My goal is simply to understand the world as a better place, though I couldn't help feeling a slight attraction to them in their amazing will; but, just the older end of the range that I consider part of this group. I said that I'm not a pedo.

With homemade binoculars over his green-framed glasses, Snead(ophile) viewed the activities of a set of teenagers. Walking and enjoying their presences. I will admit that there are exceptions in the study; he found that many were vandals and arsonists. But, this occurred mostly from evil parenting. Like the magnificent canine, if brought up well, they will be fantastic.

I continued to follow these canines; I consider my spirit animals to be the Russian fox and Norweigian bear. I don’t really know why. Through the park they ventured; further and further fucking cliche. Eventually I had to stop and eat; at some point I had stopped to get some Oka and Sakura cheeses, as well as Italian garlic bread whaat!. Soon, though, I lost their trail; it was late anyways, so I returned home too many semicolons. I wondered where they had gone, considering they had not gone home; probably sex in the bushes cuz that's what teens do. Damnit, I shouldn't've stopped for food. That's new; I saw that my door had been spraypainted with "SNEADO THE PEDO". Ugh. It might be true anyways. I munch on bread, walk in, and sink into my bed.
