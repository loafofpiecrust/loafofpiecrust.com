I wake up in the morning and my eyes dont like it. I do it slow so as not to upset them, but really they wanna stay shut. So, they tell my mouth to groan and everything else to arch. It all snaps back together and into place, my eyes throw up their arms:

> "Shit, since everyone else is awake..."

I turn over, swing my legs off the bed, still in yesterday's pants. See my feet and think of hobbits. My sheets are striped and I love bread. I check the bridge to my neighbor's roof hasn't blown down yet. Clamp down the spiral stairs, leaning against the hardwall. End up in the hallway then to the kitchen and open every single cabinet looking for it. I go through all the drawers and bottom-cabinets and can't fucking find it.

> "What the _fuck_?!"
>
> "Doko desuka?!"

I'm gettin' real pissed at all the shit, slammin drawers shut, utensils slashing inside. I was grunting like a wilder-than-human animal and making the biggest goddamned ruckus. But then, there was a sudden flash in the very first cabinet I opened. _There_ were the motherfucking bagels. I _flipping_ knew it.

Now that I had found the bagels, it was a godsend that all the cheeses were in all their correct places in the fridge. I think I may have murdered someone if they weren't. Goddamned water-spoutn' fridge of insults.
