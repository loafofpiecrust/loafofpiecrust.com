# The Fireside
-----------

I held his hand like a lover. I was quite nervous, but I knew I’d get over it. He wasn’t going anywhere, and had nowhere to go but my side. I pushed my left cheek up against his, and felt the goosebumps on my shoulder blades crest waves across my whole body. His fair skin was perfectly cool to my #[red hot](#af143e) cheeks and I could feel the lines of his jaw and cheek and teeth, soft yet firm. The signature of his face was formed by these and the scar along it’s edge. In these few moments that were passing, I let out a wavering sigh of delight at how close I was to him; I couldn’t contain myself. I squeezed his hand tighter, our fingers intertwined, and laid my head next to his, leaning on his shoulder as we lay there on our wide, firm bed. He maintained his composure, eyes shut in a seemingly peaceful slumber. I gazed across at his somber face, closed eyes and knew I was in love by how much I thoroughly enjoyed being in his company. I knew of nothing that could make me happier than to be with him.

> “Rosa! What are you doing?! Get back to work!”

My half-open eyes shot wide with surprise and I hopped up off the table, knocking my man’s limp arm over a bit. In my daze, I was half-surprised that he didn't wake up.

> “I’m sorry! I’ll get started immediately!”

My supervisor promptly left the room in a bit of a huff.

I opened up the bag, laying out my tools on the nearest adjacent table to where he lay, pulled out my scalpel, and drew it down his torso, then pulled back the cold, pale skin of his chest down to his sides. Even his #[organs](#78909C) looked nice. Minutes later, I discovered that they felt quite nice as well, only continuing to reaffirm and extend my infatuation with John Doe. My investigation brought me to the confirmation that the cause of death was not the blow to his face, but a blunt smash to the ribs, crushing his lungs and causing suffocation. #[His breath is forever taken away, just as a lover’s would be.] I tossed the autopsy report on a desk to be done later; I was going to savor my time with John while I could. In my frequent, hidden habit, I carefully extracted his left eyeball, iris of #[amber](#FFAB00), a souvenir so as to never be forgotten by his last lover before the flames of destruction evaporate his physical form. My clamp is well-worn and reliable, keeping the sphere in mint condition during extraction. Before I put him into the burning-box, I gave John Doe a soft kiss on the forehead, holding his removed eye to my side and shutting my own eyes to hold onto this moment. This second felt as if it lasted for a hundred, but inevitably it had to end. I stared at his remaining eye one last time, reminding myself how much I rejoiced in his silent, longing friendship, saying nothing to bother or be bothered; he just was and stayed that way without trouble. His death had only been the start of a pleasant existence on my table, at my side. Finally, I dispassionately shoved yet another corpse into the box, to be turned to ashes and spread about the Earth. Nothing else was to be done; death is a fleeting thing.
