# Chapter 2 – Gouda is Buddha, and Bread is Jesus

### (yes, I know only the first half rhymes)
___________

The love of cheese had always been there. Nothing is better than its deliciousness; despite this, too much can dull its long-lasting effect. Thus, bread has been a long accompanying partner of any and all cheeses. We and the Pastafarians have a mutually strange respect of each other. I decided to wake myself up to the blabbering of the water and wind; I hated their conversations. I sleep in purely my cleansing lab coat, as it's the only way I've found the ability to drift into an unconscious state. Beams of delight passed through the windows onto the annoyed cherry-wood, and the dirty breath of humanity began to exhale. As yesterday presented little, I'll return to my perch this day. I migrated for the seasons of the month between multiple sites to attempt to prevent any possible suspicion, and for differentiation of environment to prevent boredom, depression, or constance in observations. Socks, shoes, pocket watch, the rest of my clothes, grab the remnants of a wheel of classic half-mild half-sharp cheddar each bite is a surprise, always binoculars. My binoculars, in fact, were of quite fair quality, as their zoom surpassed most bought in the market of the general consumer while being shorter than most as well. Tiny little doohickey-thingies are attached on the glass to enhance zoom. Already wearing labcoat. To start the day, I choose: Bel Paese, Romano, and Cheddar. The accompaniment to this is some Anpan and Brioche. I feel biscuity today. The ability to walk anywhere is fantastic when you aren't a rich arse and don't own an automobile. On the way to the middle-class park, I decided that I must find something more productive or informative today instead of watching only the interactions of children. I will still watch the children, but.... in a more productive way. Landing next to a tree on my flight, I put on my binoculars like glasses and sat in the shade, seeming asleep. I don't see much activity, but decide that it's a decent day to sleep, to dream productively of course. Shortly, I hear the chattering of a jester, "IT'S SNEADOPHILE". "Goddamnit." This is the one who fancies himself painted gunmetal-grey, though he doesn't live anywhere near up to this. He jokes only because his life has gone to shit and his satisfaction hinges on absolutely believing that mine is worse. It warranted no response. He looked at my face awkwardly for a few moments, maybe hoping that I’d respond or fight back. The jester exited my vision and hopefully my entire existence. Eyes open. A girl is in my face. Never sure what to think of this; "Hello?". "Hi. I've been watching you, Mr. Sneadophile." Nobody can call me a weirdo anymore, when there's this person stalking me. For descriptional purposes, she’s notedly Asian and of medium height, average in enough ways, enrobed in a blue tracksuit. She utters a question after brief silence, "How do you do?" and tilts her head.

Cheese, cheese, cheese. All of its kinds and types are enjoyable. Beyond the food, think beyond the food. There’s more to cheese than melting it perfectly onto a delightedly awaiting tortilla (pronounced as en los Estados Unidos) chip. There exists emotional cheese, mental cheese. These types of cheese are exemplified by 80s pop music and the 1997 James Cameron film ‘Titanic’, and can be almost equally enjoyable. This film ran itself off on the television in my apartment, and I stared at it, speaking these words in my head. That girl is watching me space out. How did we get in here? I forget. Did I let her in? Did she follow me? I really do wonder sometimes where I go. Maybe its all these damn words that I imagine going through a typewriter in my head. But if I were to stop writing, I’d be preventing my future self from having a good laugh.

> “Hello. Hola. Kon’nichiwa. Ni Hao.” -her, a tad impatiently

> “Privjet” -me, faintly, rattling off yet another international greeting I got from some modern website's homepage.

I pretend to keep staring into space so that maybe she might just leave me alone. Of course that doesn’t happen, but dammit can’t a man have his dreams? I make a determined expression, furrowed brow, preparing to face and fight the world for the rights of a man’s damned dreams that he has a fucking right to dream! Martin Luther King did it, and I’m even white! Shit, that’s racist. Disappointment replaces the passion as race brings me to yet another wall in life.

> “Why did you invite me in if you were going to stare at DiCaprio the whole time?”

I finally focus my vision on her dark green eyes. Google tells me that the color is “Hooker’s Green”; I hope that has nothing to do with her occupation. They’re nice eyes though. Right, right, I have to talk.

> “Uhm, well, I thought you might want some cheese and tea.”

I do my gentlemanly duty and fix her perfectly warm jasmine tea and a bowl of feta. The tanginess will work well with the bitter tastes of jasminity.

> “I’ve been watching you in the park, you know.”

> “Why?”

> “Because I want to, why else would I watch a suspected pedophile in the park? Well, I mean I don't have be afraid of you, I am over the age of 12.”
