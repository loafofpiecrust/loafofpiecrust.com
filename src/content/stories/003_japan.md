# 日本が大好き ~ Me amo japón
---

We wandered into one of the shopping centers of Asia that grows endlessly into the sky, each floor containing an invariably different set of products than the one below it. Drift up one of the many escalators, along with the rest of Japan. We collectively looked around, eyelights sliding from one end of the room to the other in 182 degrees of wonder. Her and me walked around, checking out the items that filled the walls and booths and shops, but this floor was of little interest. I don't even remember what kind of stuff was there.
"Do you wanna go to the next floor? I think it's Gundam up there." -I
"Uhm... sure, yeah!" -she, with a smile.
So we took another of the countless escalators, and reached the floor that was, in fact, filled with Gundam figures. Filled to the brim. This was definitely the volume that starts to draw all the fans, rather than just the solitary mid-20s that go to specialty shops. This volume puts in your face the fact that by such American standards, everyone in this nation is a nerd.
"Whoa.." -we

We had taken this trip to Nippon after discussing it in art class one day:
> "You know, I was thinking about going to Japan." ~I

> "**REALLY?** Take me with you!" ~Her

And thus, the next morning, we together departed.

When we were leaving the previously mentioned shopping center, she spotted the line for some bizarre game of teams. We were not sure of anything about this game of teams, but we hopped into line anyway. We had some guarantee to be on the same team by being at an even number in the line and being adjacent in such a line. We were given "6 lives" and, when we hit the entrance, shuffled into an underground tunnel. There were periodic boxes on each side, probably 5 feet from their respective walls. She and I were lined up along the left wall with a bunch of other pairs. This was our greater team. The other side consisted of our enemy team. We were supposed to shoot each other or something. This was a surreal game of laser tag with very little instruction, it seemed. At one point, late in the game (as it did drag on for hours), some people from both teams dressed in big, ornate animal costumes. One was dressed as a lion, with the big black pleather paws, felt strips of a mane, and velvety fur. Many things you could imagine hung from his body, shaking around and hiding their identity. Him and the others paraded down the middle line, very fragrantly, and at random points, shot down people in both teams. I asked them what the hell was going on, and one turned and whisper-yelled at my face: "Don't you want this game to end already? We're speeding it up!". I couldn't really argue much with that, especially since he was speaking Japanese, and I could only catch a couple of the words: `want`, `we`, and `it`. Really not that useful. This game did eventually finish, though, with me and she being the only ones left. I dashed out the exit, arms in the air for victory that was very drawn out and unclear.

These Asian men were dressed as Native Americans, and were playing a victory song on various stereotypically ornamented instruments. I ran past them and outside, where she jump-hug-attacked me. We stumbled off into the sunset, our arms around each other.

Back with the fake native Americans, a group of real native Americans showed up, carrying their instruments. They saw their fake, Japanese counterparts and collectively figured they could do a much better job of playing that song, sat down next to them, and played much better and louder. The Japanese men were quite perplexed at this point, as half of them had never seen a Native American in real life anyway. The other half were still very confused as to why they would be there. But, the real deal was truly much better than their weak playing, so they gave up and left the premises, whereupon the Native Americans took up their jobs. Their employer noticed no difference and issued paychecks just the same.

Another group left the shopping center that day as well, a Japanese father and his younger son. They took a train home, and on the way over, the clouds had started bickering about when they would start raining, and one annoyed cumulonimbus finally just started pouring the buckets down "Because those other clouds are fucking idiots". The son and father rushed up to the door of their house, *popped open* the door, and fell inside. They greeted the older son, who had stayed at home, looking out the far window at the thunder, lightning, and despair that flooded the streets outside.

> "Mother still isn't home" he says.

The father knows not what to do. He stares out the window for a moment of silence with his sons.
> "I'll go find her"

The younger son is less concerned, or at least more faithful in his mother:
> "No. She'll come back."

Their mother had been gone a whole day, so the older son is relatively less certain but still on board with this idea:
> "Yeah.. I think she is gonna come back herself"

The father did not know what in the world to do for the love of his life.

`Pan out, as the family stares into the rain. Father sits down. Black.`
