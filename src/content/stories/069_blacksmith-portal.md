### Where are the damned hoverboards?

There’s only one man in the world who knows what it is like to time travel. He has not done it himself, but his creations very frequently do. There’s some kinda portal in his house, kinda like in Inuyasha, except it isn’t big enough to fit a humanoid person.

He’s a blacksmith dude, makes swords and sells them to mystified beings on the other side. He has never seen them, and so doesn’t quite know what they are exactly, but he is very certain that their currency consists in some way of golden and silveren pieces, as they usually toss those through when he sends a bladed hilt flying through a hole in a tree. It seems that they appreciated his business. Sometimes, they even come back for repairs.

He thought about being on that smithy game show, but decided that it was probably a bit beneath him, especially considering he lived at a magical tree-hole, in Indiana.

Maybe he’s that one guy that said that one thing about time travel.
