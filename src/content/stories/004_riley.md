# Story!
_________

She looked a bit young for her age of something like 16, 17, but she did act older than that as well. She was half-idly staring at herself in a mirror. A mirror in a bathroom. A smudged mirror in the dirty bathroom of a mechanic's shop. Or rather, some mechanics' shop. She had short brown hair that stuck out on the sides. She was trying to pretty herself up a little bit. The hair had its own charm, her breasts were small-medium, but enough. Some lipstick put on now. (For the sake of the slanglistical improvement of the English language, I would like to invent a word here). Some liplush. She looked down at the browning sink, falling off the wall. There was hair stuck in the drain. That's kinda gross.

The owners of this fine establishment were in various places outside of the bathroom, two young man-brothers. Her Mercedes was out back, and one of the brothers was admiring her and another's appreciated leftovers from the 80s. She stepped down off the milk crate. She wasn't that short, that mirror was just unrealistically high above the shitty sink and the reasonable eye-height of any human being. One last look at the gross-ass toilet (is that rusting wood?), and she's outta there. She goes into the office of the other, middle-parted-hair brother, the one that goes by Hektor Felk with both K's because he wanted to feel cool. She was going to need an oil change for her car, and she thought she'd do it the right way. She looks at him with her harsh, slightly different shades of green eyes. If it's not evident at this point, and you need more context, she is going to seduce him. I will not explain or narrate further, because I don't even really understand it myself. But she's quite good at this kind of thing, especially with young men like this. She was doing this because she had been burned just recently before, and would not have the chance of being fucked over yet again. If you are confused, fuck you.

Outside now in the gas-station-looking carport area, Hector/Hektor is putting oil into her Eighties Mercedes. After that, he starts filling her gas tank too, cuz why not. This all seemed like pretty routine thing until he started pouring gasoline all over everything except the vehicle. All over the ground, spraying it onto the building, the carport roof, shooting it onto the back of his brother looking the other way, still admiring that other sweet, sweet ass of diesel-guzzling metal. He was too excited to notice that he was also getting that shit all over himself, as well.
The back door of the Mercedes was open.

> “Get in.” -she smiled at him with that subtle liplush

> “I love you!” -he said in quite an odd situation to say that.

As he reached for the door, she screeched off, quickly whipping out a match from a matchbox labelled 'Czusac' (she's slutty when she's drunk), lighting it, and flicking it in the direction of his mouth. It landed not quite on his tongue, but it still lit the shit out of the whole motherfuckin' place, including both brothers, now wailing in agony.

> “You know it, bitch.”

> “YOU PROMIIIIIIIIIISSED!!!”

Hector/Hektor screeched with a directionless force of pain. (You better still be listening to that song, it gets perfect here.)

Some other random guy had hopped into her car while she was tossing the match, but she didn't mind him so much. He didn't make very much noise.

Evil woman laugh far into the distance with red liplush.

I had to fucking write that 3 times because Microsoft Office sucks trucks of assholes. Trucks of assholes.



# Chapter 2 – The prequel.
---

Our girl is taken prisoner or in some situation where this gang has control of her and her car. They are threatening to blow up her car, and she really doesn't want that to happen. She loves her car, and she's rigged it up to do the Nightrider thing with Voice recognition.

They beat her up, possibly. She somehow gets away and kills them with guns. She definitely has harsh eyes now. Like the young Stark sister from the Game of Thrones show. She gets away to her Eighties Mercedes and drives away, but sees that she needs to get an oil change. Fucking hell, after all that, something so mundane. Well, it must be done.
> “Guess I'll go ahead and do that now.”
