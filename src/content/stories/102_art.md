I was at an art gallery this evening for the monthly gallery day in my neighborhood. Most of the time, I'm pretty bored. I go and walk around, see people that I know from around, say `Hi, how's it going?` like we really are interested. The many, many thirty-something men with `red beards`{:.deep-orange}, modest beer bellies, and beers in their hands. One of them I know plays Magic The Gathering. It all fits. I look around at the random and relatively meaningless splats and bars and offhand strokes of paint on miscellaneous canvases on the wall of this single bedroom sized gallery. I know the artist, and I wouldn't tell him, of _course_, but I didn't understand the work _at all_.

I get to wondering about the meaning of these meaningless things and watched other people examine them thoughtfully as people always, _always_, do. They never say anything about it, discuss shit with anyone. Unless they're onena those snobs, but those aren't really people. They don't count. I really wonder if anyone is actually in deep, meaningful thought about artwork when they see it on the wall, or if they're all just staring blankly, then moving along. I'm really very inclined to think the latter.

People are always looking at art like it's supposed to be something. They keep looking because everyone around them is doing the same. They just keep going every month to have an excuse to drink some alcohol and talk for a couple hours while getting to feel cultured.
