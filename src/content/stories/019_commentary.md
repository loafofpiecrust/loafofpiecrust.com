Is there a love story? I'm not really sure. There might be. There might not be. There could be multiple love stories. There's maybe Ian and Bjorn. Though they could just have been friends instead.

Really there’s a love story between the universe and the ones who accept it for who it is. Just like any other love story that exists. Like my friend, Mr. Trendy, with his family of community having feasts and things. He lived his life in deep love with the life that he lived, the country, the world. He was simply happy, didn’t need the rest of all that shit.

As the brother in [Little Miss Sunshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkjhhNtW8JY) once said:

> “You know what? Do what you love, and fuck the rest!”

He also said this:

> “FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!”

She always kept thinking “What, what, what, what, what?” in that voice we all knew we hated. It was quite infathomable to hear inside her mind as it was so full of nothing. Yes, that same nothing that we know and love from the wolf of the Neverending Story. But we know in the end Falcor will save us (watch: [Neverending Story](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088323/), it’s good emotional cheese). From the wretched naievity of this white-girl. Little is to be done. She’s a confused little bunny in the world of many many other less confused contemptuous bunnies (read: children's books). Yes, I spell things how I hear them. Language is what you make it. Just like life, or love. She doesn’t believe in what I believe in. Her hair is too straight. Her feet are too hidden.

I like feet. Boku-maru.
