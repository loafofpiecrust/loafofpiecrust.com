# It's Prom

> “Oh my god! Snead!!”

That asian girl that I know was here. She used to go to our school, but left two years ago. She still comes to our dances.

> “Your hair is so long!” She says.

> “Yeah, I know!”
>
> Always what I say.

We’re essentially yelling at each other to decipher what is a whisper’s decibel above the music. She giggles in a complete way, a way where her eyes shut, nose crinks, and body shakes a little bit. I’ve described it before, it’s the genuine kind of laugh. It isn’t fake or for attention or for attraction, but it’s just a laugh.

We danced to the song “Orgasm Addict” by The Buzzcocks, which is a great song by the way. And then we decided to go sit down to eat some hard cookies and drink some teeth-rotting root beer.

> “Yo! What’s up, Claire?”

> “You mean Riley?” Says my tall, asian, female friend.

These friggin’ genderfluid names kids are coming up with these days are pretty confusing. One day this girl goes by “Margo”, the next day she goes by “Mika” pronounced like “Micah”. Then, you gotta distinguish who’s doing it because they actually feel genderfluid and who’s doing it because they think it’s cool. Who knows. Riley, or Claire, either way she was the person that I knew by face, by personality, by human identity.

> “Yeah, same thing.” -I

> “Hey, Snead.”

Says Claire, then resumes making out with the bleach blonde clone of herself.

Me and Alexa sit down to eat our cookies at the fake-silk clothed table in our fancy clothes that get slowly tussled throughout the night that by the end will just be completely out of order. For once, I was enjoying the time.

It was finally the night when they played music that wasn’t absolute shite, when it felt like the people might’ve felt a little bit of something for each other. When people might actually care in some form of shape.

But then again, maybe it’s all just the drugs. Especially considering, now, out the corner of my eye I see our class president snorting cocaine from atop a box-made `crimson velvet cupcake`{:.redvelvet}.
