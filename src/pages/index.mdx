You know that feeling when you eat a slice of pie?
That feeling that maybe there's going to be delight at the end of the next bite?
That maybe you should just eat the crust by itself instead?
My dream is to fulfill this desire with a loaf of pie crust.

I am a software engineer and university student residing in Boston, MA, USA.
While my strongest skills lie in computer science, my greatest passion is linguistics, particularly the study of low-resource languages and cross-linguistic variation.
I spend most of my waking time building [stuff](/projects) and occasionally thinking up wild thoughts.
Professionally, I've worked for software companies and on various freelance projects for artist organizations.
If you'd be interested in hiring me for a project, check out my [resume](/resume), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snead-t/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/loafofpiecrust).

I want to find meaning in producing software that, rather than simply increasing laziness and ignorance, expressly looks for new avenues of experience.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and baking and crafting things from wood and fabric. I'm constantly [traveling](/about/places). Sometimes, I even like to [write](/stories) or [blog](/blog).
